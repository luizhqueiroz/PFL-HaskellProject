# Functional and Logic Programming

# Haskell

This project consists of two parts: 
- In part 1, it is considered a lower-level machine that receives a list of instructions and executes them, thus being able to modify the evaluation stack or the storage.  
- In part 2, it is considered a small imperative programming language that includes arithmetic and boolean expressions and statements, which need to be translated into the list of instructions defined in part 1
